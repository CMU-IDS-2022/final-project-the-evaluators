## **Description**

**Domain**: University Course Evaluations

**Stakeholders**: Students, Course Instructors, Department Heads


## **Research Question**:



* How to equip students with all the required knowledge to make an informed decision while selecting university courses and planning their semester? 
* How to help them compare different courses based on different criterias like course goals, instructor’s feedback, student reviews, courseload etc?
* How to equip instructors and university department heads to easily view, analyze and understand the course quality, and criterias to improve?


## **Ideas：**



* Search and filter the courses.
* Compare courses.
    * Overall data visualization of the selected courses.
    * Head to head courses comparison.
    * The data can be compared by: _Hrs per week, Interest in student learning, clearly explain course requirements, clear learning objectives goals, instructor provides feedback to students to improve, explains subject matter of course, show respect for all students _
* Visualize the progress of each course through years. 
    * Many courses have been offered for many years, some of them are getting better score, some of them might get worse. By visualizing the progress of the course, we can see the trend of the course, and how well each professor does.
